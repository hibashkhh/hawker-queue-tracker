# Smart Hawker Queue Tracker 🧠🥢

A simple Python desktop app built with **Tkinter** to help users track and compare queue lengths at hawker stalls.

### Features
- Add or update queue numbers for each stall
- View all current stalls and their queue lengths
- Suggest the stall with the shortest queue

### Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Dictionary data structure for real-time updates

### Why I Built This
Inspired by Singapore’s hawker culture, this mini-project was created to explore how basic technology can help improve everyday decisions — like where to eat faster! Great example of applying **information systems thinking** to a real-world scenario.

### Run It
```bash
python smart_hawker_queue_tracker.py# hawker-queue-tracker
 users input the stall name and the current queue length. It’s designed to be simple so anyone — a hawker, a customer, or even a market assistant — can use it on a shared tablet or desktop near the stall.
